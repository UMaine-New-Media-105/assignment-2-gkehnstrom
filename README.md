For A2Q1 we were tasked to make a canvas with our initial out of rectangles while using a function, I did a 5x5 style with a dark purple and a
light purple to create the shape of the letter G which represents my first name, per line I used a function "addLine1() etc to make sure i can call in each 
line whenver I want. https://editor.p5js.org/gkehnstrom/sketches/VWJTVweQG

For A2Q2 we were tasked to create a custom shape and so I created a heart with a red outline, using Begin shape and end shape and a decent amount of vertex's
I created a nice heart. https://editor.p5js.org/gkehnstrom/sketches/d09SQ6Bng

For A2Q3 we were tasked to center our heart and then duplicate that heart using a function and size it down so that when you call it in the sprite / heart 
automattically starts at the top left of the screen (0,0) on call. https://editor.p5js.org/gkehnstrom/sketches/EzidLna-A

For A2Q4 we were tasked to combine two flags to create our own flags, the flags do have some menaing to us though. One flag has to start with the first letter
of your first name and the second flag has to start with the first letter of yout last name, I chose Eritrea and Guatemala becuase it correlates to my name
